# Markov
markov chain library

### issues
You could give input such that that a Sequence or TextGenerator has a terminating node (so if it reaches it it will result in null), but I can implement a CircularSequence such that the last points to the first element or something. It is also the case that I should just trust the user to make a faulty chain.
